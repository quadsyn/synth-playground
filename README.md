## Building

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org). Then run:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run build
```

Assuming the code is correct, type checking can be skipped with
`npm run build-fast`, which should take less time. Useful for tweaking the UI.

There's also `npm run build-dev` and `npm run build-dev-fast`, which skip
minification, making debugging easier.
